#             COMPILING              #
######################################

To compile, be sure to have in your path
- a C11 able compiler (e.g. gcc-4.9)
- the mercurium compiler for OmpSs
and to have installed
- nanos
- extrae
- papi

Adjust variables if they don't comply to the following defaults :
CC  = gcc-4.9                            # C11 compiler
MCC = mcc                                # mercurium compiler
NANOS_HOME = /apps/PM/ompss/2014-04-10
PAPI_HOME = /apps/PAPI/5.0.1
EXTRAE_HOME = /apps/CEPBATOOLS/extrae/latest/default/64

e.g. :
$ make NANOS_HOME=/usr/local

Each different configuration will be compiled in a subdirectory, with up to 6 targets

- pcg, parallel version that is compiled with the instrumentation library of nanox
- pcg_seq, sequential : same as above ignoring pragmas (entirely compiled with $(CC))

- pcg_speedup, parallel version that only measures speed (compiled with performance library)
- pcg_seq_speedup, sequential : same as above ignoring pragmas (entirely compiled with $(CC))

- pcg_conv, parallel version that writes convergence and resilience values to a trace (perf)
- pcg_seq_conv, sequential : same as above ignoring pragmas (entirely compiled with $(CC))

Self explanatory targets to make one or more of the above are (plain|ompss)?(debug|conv|speedup|all)

The default make target will be a non-resilient textbook Conjugate Gradient.
You may then choose resilience strategies for Detected Uncorrected Errors (DUE),
e.g. a memory page failure, and a detector for Silent Data Corruption (SDC).

Options are :
DUE: none async path rollback lossy
SDC: none alpha ortho grad

If using an SDC detector or the rollback DUE strategy, you will need to choose a 
(not "none") checkpointing method as well.
CKPT: none disk mem

Finally, if you choose to detect SDC or to checkpoint, you must choose frequencies
(in number of iterations) to do so, thus SDC_FREQ and CKPT_FREQ.
If SDC=grad, SDC_FREQ must be a multiple of RECOMPUTE_GRAD_FREQ (defaults to 50).
If SDC is used, CKPT_FREQ must be a multiple of SDC_FREQ.

The name of each configuration's directory is then DUE_SDC(SDC_FREQ)_CKPT(CKPT_FREQ)
Some valid examples :

    configuration :                                            directory :
    
    DUE=none                                                  none_none_none
    DUE=rollback CKPT=disk CKPT_FREQ=100                      rollblack_none_disk100
    DUE=async SDC=alpha SDC_FREQ=50 CKPT=mem CKPT_FREQ=200    async_alpha50_mem200

You have to supply a file containing a spd matrix in Matrix Market format.
All other parameters are optional and described below. Some are only available for
some flavours of the resilient PCG.

Usage: ./async_alpha100_disk200/pcg [options] <matrix-market-filename> [, ...] 
Possible options are : 
 ===  fault injection  === 
  -nf               Disabling faults simulation (default).
  -l     lambda     Inject errors with lambda meaning MTBE in usec.
  -nerr  N duration Inject N errors over a period of duration in usec.
                    Note : the options -nf, -l and -nerr are mutually exclusive.
  -mfs   strategy   Select an alternate strategy for multiple faults (cf Agullo2013).
                    'strategy' must be one of : global, uncorrelated, decorrelated.
                    Note : has no effect without errors. global is default.
 === run configuration === 
  -th    threads    Manually define number of threads.
  -nb    blocks     Defines the number of blocks in which to divide operations ;
                    their size will depdend on the matrix' size.
  -r     runs       number of times to run a matrix solving.
  -cv    thres      Run until the error verifies ||b-Ax|| < thres * ||b|| (default 1e-10).
  -maxit N          Run no more than N iterations (default no limit).
  -seed  s          Initialize seed of each run with s. If 0 use different (random) seeds.
 === resilience method === 
  -ps    size       Defines page size (used on failure, in bytes, defaults to 4K).
                    Must be a multiple of the system page size (and a power of 2).
  -disk  /path/dir  Path to a directory on local disk for checkpointing (default $TMPDIR).
  -ckpt             Prefix of the name of checkpoint files.
  -sdc    tol       Consider SDC occured if detector yields a value > tol (default 1e-12).
All options apply to every following input file. You may re-specify them for each file.


e.g. the following command will run CG once with a MTBE of 1e8 us, and once without error
injection (without reloading the matrix from file) :

$ ./pcg -l 1e8 <file>.mtx -nf <file>.mtx

######################################

In the subdirectory utils/ you will find paraver configuration files that allow to view
symbols outputted to traces that are specific to this application.

The trace_to_plot.py script extracts these informations from configuration files into a
format that can be fed to any viewing tool, to plot convergence and SDC detection values
over time.
